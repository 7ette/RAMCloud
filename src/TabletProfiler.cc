/*
 * The TabletProfiler object efficiently tracks usage of table key spaces and
 * enables computation of partitions that have a bounded error in size and
 * number of referants. A referant is a generic term for whatever the key
 * refers to, be it an object, a tombstone, or something else.
 *
 * The motivation is as follows. In RAMCloud, we attempt to provide locality
 * in the key space (i.e. keys close together should prefer living on the same
 * server). However, for recovery to be efficient, we need to divvy up the key
 * space into contiguous, non-overlapping regions of a desired maximal size.
 * This maximum size dictates how long it takes to recover the partition of a
 * failed master on a new node.
 *
 * The trouble with this approach is that dividing the key space into chunks
 * of keys that represent referants totalling a specific number of bytes is
 * hard, as the access patterns are not predictable and we cannot expect an even
 * distribution within the key space. For instance, users could append only to
 * the beginning of the key space. They could also use random hashes for keys.
 * Or, perhaps key bits are partitioned (the upper 32-bits are a user id, the
 * lower 32-bits are some metadata, etc). They could even use multiple such
 * methods on the same table. Furthermore, referants may also be deleted or
 * overwritten. All of these result in unpredictable densities in the key space,
 * which makes our task more difficult.
 *
 * The TabletProfiler tackles this problem in an approximate way, however it can
 * bound error. That is, if we want partitions of 500 MB, we can guarantee that
 * what we compute is within a reasonable range of 500. Our approach  works as
 * follows. The entire key space is described by a root Subrange, an object that
 * splits the whole 64-bit space into evenly-sized regions and tracks the number
 * of referants and referant bytes used by keys in each region. Each even split
 * of a Subrange is called a Bucket. Buckets maintain statistics about the
 * number of referants and referant bytes within the range they track.
 *
 * When a Bucket gets large (either in number of bytes, or number of referants),
 * it makes sense to take a closer look at that range so that we can more
 * accurately make partitions. We do so by pointing the Bucket to a new child
 * Subrange, which spans the same range as the Bucket. This gives us a higher
 * resolution for a hot key space. Although we don't know where the previous
 * tracked referants fall within each of the new smaller Buckets of the child
 * Subrange, we can track any new key insertions into the range more precisely.
 *
 *
 * These nested Subranges form a tree hierarchy. Each next level down the tree
 * corresponds to smaller and smaller Subranges of the key space. For instance,
 * if each Subrange has 256 Buckets, then the root Subrange's Buckets each
 * describe 1/256th of the whole 64-bit key space. Buckets in Subranges
 * immediately under a root Bucket then describe 1/256th of that 1/256th of the
 * 64-bit key space, or simply 1/2^16th. By setting the number of Buckets per
 * Subrange, we can control how many levels are necessary to zoom in and track
 * very small key ranges, as well as the memory overhead for each allocated
 * level. This presents a trade-off: if each level shaves off fewer bits of the
 * address space, we require more levels and therefore longer traversals.
 * However, more bits per level imply larger Subrange structures.
 *
 * A useful analogy for the structure that these Subranges form may be processor
 * page tables. E.g., each lower level describes a smaller range of addresses,
 * and each higher level can potentially point to larger contiguous pages.
 *
 * When tracking a new referant, statistical updates are reflected in the lowest
 * appropriate Subrange of the tree. Initially, only a root Subrange exists and
 * counts are updated in its Buckets. As the tree grows, the lowest bucket (i.e.
 * the tightest Subrange) corresponding to a given key is updated. This method
 * enables us to dynamically drill down on hot key ranges, all the way to single
 * key granularity, if necessary. Note that the amount of resources employed in
 * tracking is simply proportional to the density of a key range. Futhermore, by
 * deciding to zoom in on a range only after seeing a relatively low threshold
 * number of bytes or referants in that range, we can bound the error introduced
 * in computing partitions. That is, the referants we've tracked at a higher
 * level of the tree exist somewhere in an exponentially larger key space than
 * those tracked lower down. We therefore can't attribute them accurately to
 * fine-grained ranges of the key space. However, if the number of levels in the
 * tree is reasonably small and the maximum size before splitting a Bucket into
 * a new lower Subrange is small, the total error is small.
 *
 * For example, say that all Buckets may track at most 8MB of referants within
 * their range before starting a new child Subrange and each Subrange splits its
 * range into 256 Buckets. We then have at most 8 levels in the tree. To form a
 * new partition, we must draw a dividing line in the key space. Between this
 * new divider and the previous one we know the exact number of bytes and
 * referants tracked in the range except for in at most two leaf Subranges that
 * correspond to the border lines between partitions. In the border Subrange(s),
 * our error is at most the sum of the up to 7 previous tree levels' worth of
 * referants, each of which may fall before or after our dividing lines. In
 * our example, we have at worst 8*7 = 56MB of referants above us in the tree
 * that may come before or after.
 *
 * There are two main parameters of our structure that we care about:
 *      B - The number of bits of key space each Subrange spans.
 *      S - The maximum number of bytes each Bucket should track, before
 *          creating a child Subrange for more accurate accounting.
 *
 * (There is an additional parameter analogous to S for the number of referants
 *  per range, rather than total bytes, but it behaves in essentially the same
 *  way as S.)
 *
 * If each Subrange covers B bits of the key space, then that range is split
 * into 2^B individual Buckets. (Actually, if 64 isn't evenly divisible by B,
 * then the last level may have fewer, but this is a minor detail.) B dictates
 * the overhead involved in allocating each next Subrange. If each Bucket is 16
 * bytes, then each Subrange is approximately B * 16 bytes in size.
 *
 * Using B and S we can compute the worst case overhead that the TabletProfiler
 * structure imposes on the system, as well as the maximum error we can
 * experience in computing partitions. This second aspect is especially
 * important, as it lets us compute the error bound.
