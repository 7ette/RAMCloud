/**
 * Context is a container for global variables.
 *
 * Its main purpose is to allow multiple instances of these variables to
 * coexist in the same address space. This is useful for a variety of reasons,
 * for example:
 *  - Accessing RAMCloud from multiple threads in a multi-threaded client
 *    application without locking.
 *  - Running a simulator of RAMCloud in which multiple clients and servers
 *    share a single process.
 *  - Running unit tests in parallel in the same process.
 *
 * Context also defines an explicit order in which these variables are
 * constructed and destroyed. Without such an ordering, it's easy to run into
 * memory corruption problems (e.g., RAM-212).
 *
 * Expected usage: on client machines there will be one Context per RamCloud
 * object, which also means one Context per thread.  On server machines there
 * is a single Context object shared among all the threads.

    // Rationale:
    // - These are pointers to the heap to work around circular dependencies in
    //   header files.
    // - They are exposed publicly rather than via accessor methods for
    //   convenience in caller code.
    // - They are not managed by smart pointers (such as std::unique_ptr)
    //   because they need to be constructed and destroyed while inside this
    //   context (since later members may depend on earlier ones). That's
    //   pretty awkward to achieve with smart pointers in the face of
    //   exceptions.
