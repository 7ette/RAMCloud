/**
 * The Dispatch class keeps track of interesting events such as open files
 * and timers, and arranges for particular methods to be invoked when the
 * events happen. The inner loop for the class is polling-based, and it
 * allows additional polling-based event handlers to be added.  The current
 * implementation does not support concurrent invocations from multiple
 * threads; for example:
 * - It is not safe for #poll to be invoked simultaneously in multiple threads.
 * - But, once #poll has invoked a handler it is safe to invoke #poll again
 *   in that thread or in another thread.
 * - It is not safe to create a new Dispatch::File while #poll is "active".
 * - But, if #poll has invoked a handler it is no longer active so it is safe
 *   for that handler, or another thread, to create/delete Dispatch::Files.
